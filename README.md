Point-to-Voxel Knowledge Distillation for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation (CVPR 2022)

Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks, i.e., ranks **1st** in [Waymo 3D Semantic Segmentation Challenge](https://waymo.com/open/challenges/2022/3d-semantic-segmentation/) (the "Cylinder3D" and "Offboard_SemSeg" entities), ranks **1st** in [SemanticKITTI LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20331#results) (single-scan, the "Point-Voxel-KD" entity), ranks **3rd** in [SemanticKITTI LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Challenge](https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/20331#results) (multi-scan, the "PVKD" entity).

Codes will be released soon!
